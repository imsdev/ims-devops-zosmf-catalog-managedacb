# IMS catalog with managed ACBs workflow for z/OSMF

## Overview

You can rapidly provision the catalog with [IMS™ management of application control blocks](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPH2_14.1.0/com.ibm.ims14.doc.sdg/ims_catalog_acb_mgmt.htm) (ACBs) by using the IBM® z/OS® Management Facility (z/OSMF) with this z/OSMF workflow sample.

IMS can manage the ACBs for databases and program views for you. When IMS manages ACBs, IMS no longer requires DBD, PSB, and ACB libraries.

The workflow will provision the catalog with managed ACBs to an existing IMS with these steps:
* Create the catalog database.
* Create the IMS DFSDFxxx proclib members to enable IMS catalog with managed ACBs.
* Load the catalog database.
* Build the IMS catalog directory data sets.

As an optional step, the workflow can also create an image copy of the HALDB catalog database.

## Pre-requisites
* An SMP/E installation of IMS is done and the IMS load libraries are available.
* Identify the z/OS system parameters.
* IMS SVC modules are installed on the system.
* The Common Service Layer must be started.
* z/OSMF must be started. Both the angel and server z/OSMF address spaces must be started. 

## Security requirements 
To run the workflow, you need the following authority:
* RACF READ authority on SMP/E-installed IMS libraries.
* RACF UPDATE authority on the high-level qualifiers (HLQs) you are using for the IMS instance libraries.
* Authority to ADD or DELETE APF authorizations.

## Package structure 
The repository includes the following files:
* setUpCatalogManagedACB.xml
  * This workflow XML provisions the catalog with managed ACBs. Do not modify this file.
* workflow_variables.properties
  * This properties file contains values for the variables referenced in the setUpCatalogManagedACB.xml workflow. Edit the workflow_variables.properties file to specify your system specific information for the variables in the file.

## Installation 
* Use FTP to transfer the setUpCatalogManagedACB.xml workflow and the workflow_variables.properties files to USS on the z/OS host in binary mode.
* Make these files visible to the z/OSMF application. Do this by changing the access permissions of the files using the chmod command.
  * Example chmod commands: 
    ```Java
    chmod 755 setUpCatalogManagedACB.xml
    ```
  * Or if the file is in a folder with the name of workflows:
    ```Java 
    chmod -R 755 workflows
    ```

## Steps to run the workflow using the z/OSMF web interface
1. Log into the IBM z/OS Management Facility web interface.
1. Select **Workflows** from the left menu.
1. Select the **Actions** drop down menu.
1. Select **Create Workflow**.
1. In the Create Workflow dialog, specify the following information:
    *	Workflow definition file: 
    *	Workflow variable input file:
    *	System:
1. Select **Next**.
1. Select **Assign all steps to owner user ID** if you are going to run all of the workflow steps with the current user ID.
1. Select **Finish**.
1. Right-click the first action and select **Perform**.

For more information about running a workflow see [Creating a workflow](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zosmfworkflows.help.doc/izuWFhpCreateWorkflowDialog.html) in the IBM Knowledge Center.

## Troubleshooting
* IZUWF0105E   Workflow property file file-name is either not found or cannot be accessed
  * Typically,this error occurs when the file does not exist at the given path. If the file does exist, access permission to the file must be set by using the chmod command.
* If there is no **Workflows** menu option in the z/OSMF web interface configure the IZUPRMxx member in SYS.PARMLIB to specify the WORKLOAD_MGMT in the PLUGINS statement. For more information see [creating a IZUPRMxx](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.izua300/izuconfig_IZUPRMxx.htm) in the IBM Knowledge Center.
  * Example: 
  
        PLUGINS(INCIDENT_LOG  
        COMMSERVER_CFG
        CAPACITY_PROV 
        SOFTWARE_MGMT 
        ISPF          
        RESOURCE_MON  
        WORKLOAD_MGMT)
